benefits = "Selendra's native token has a total supply of 3,141,592,654 SEL.\n\nToken Distribution model is as follow:\n\n- 50% of all SEL will be distributed via rewards to good actors in the network. The process is similar to mining in Bitcoin network. Validators, Collators, Nominators, Fishermen or Service nodes are our good actors. By 2041, all 50% of SEL will be shared and good actors will be rewarded based on transaction fees and other good will.\n\n- Token sale or IEO 20%: Token sale will take place sometime in 2021 and early 2022 to raise fund needed for initial network development\n\n- Selendra Team 15%. The first 1% will be given 2 years after the mainnet has launched. It will take 15 years to release all 15%.\n\n- 12%: ecosystem development and developers' fund. At maximum, 1% of SEL will be funded to developers each year, to help onboard more dApp to run on Selendra Network.\n\n- Airdrop 3%: every 3 months 5,235,988 SEL will be dropping to the community. 4.5 years span makes SEL more fairly distributed to more people.\n\nFeel free to private message me for more information."

Nominators secure the network by selecting trustworthy validators and stakers.\n\n4. Fishermen monitor the network and report abuse to validators.\n\nYou can message me for more information"

Technical committees are composed of active Selendra developers who propose emergency referenda and new features together with the Holders Council for fast-tracked voting and implementation.\n\nYou can message me for more information"
